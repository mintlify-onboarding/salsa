Welcome to Salsa!

Salsa will enable you to quickly and easily add payroll functionality to your product or platform so that you can offer it to your customers. We provide fully tailored UI experiences that are ready to be embedded in your app or hosted by Salsa, as well as both REST and GraphQL APIs to enable you to build any features that you desire.

Our documentation and examples will help you launch a payroll product fast. It is our mission to make offering payroll as simple as possible, at Salsa we know payroll, so you don't have to!

## API Access
You will receive an API Token for each of Salsa's two environments, Sandbox and Production. We recommend integrating with the Sandbox environment first to make sure everything runs smoothly before going live in Production. In addition, you will get a Client Key that can be used in your application if you choose to leverage our embedded UI Experiences.
