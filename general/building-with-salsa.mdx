## What does the Salsa platform do?
At Salsa, we handle the complexity of payroll, so you can focus on building a great product to serve employers and workers. Our goal is to make payroll accessible and give you powerful features so you can create the next generation of payroll products focusing on what matters to your customers.

To enable this, we provide APIs, embeddable UI components, and Webhook notifications that you can use as building blocks to launch a payroll experience fast. In addition to these building blocks, we have built a powerful back office that allows us to handle the hard part of payroll on your behalf. Salsa handles tax filings and payments, so you don't have to deal with thousands of federal, local, and state agencies.

### Understanding the flow of funds

Salsa has been built with the principle of being flexible to serve your needs. A critical component is our money movement rails that allow us to disburse money to workers and third parties. We take care of fraud monitoring, know-your-business processes (KYB), and anti-money laundering (AML), so you can just plug your data and get workers paid. Below is the standard flow of funds; don't hesitate to reach out if you have something different in mind, like using your money movement rails or pay cards.

### Different ways to build

Use our embeddable UI components for a fast launch, or create a custom UI through our easy-to-use REST and GraphQL APIs. We understand that different experiences require different integration methods, so we provide you with easy-to-use specialized APIs for data synchronization, allowing you to leverage any payroll data you already have. Check out the high level diagram to get the whole picture.

We refer to our **embeddable UI components as Salsa Express**, and our **REST and GraphQL APIs as Salsa Advanced**. We have available tutorials to show in simple steps how Express and Advanced work; it will give you the basic concepts and understanding of how to build with Salsa. We recommend starting there, as it will help you pick the best path into payroll.
